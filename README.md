Project Description: Salary Prediction Using Simple Linear Regression
Overview:
This project implements a  simple linear regression model to predict salaries based on various features such as years of experience. The goal is to develop a reliable model that can assist individuals and organizations in understanding salary trends and making informed decisions.

Key Features:

Data Collection: The dataset contains various attributes related to employees, including years of experience and salary.
Data Preprocessing: The project includes steps for data cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables to prepare the dataset for analysis.
Model Training: A linear regression model is trained using the processed dataset to predict salaries.
Model Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared values.

Technologies Used:

Python: Primary programming language for implementation.
NumPy & Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the linear regression model.
Matplotlib: For data visualization and analysis.

Results:
The project outputs predicted salaries and visualizes the regression line against actual salary data, demonstrating the model's performance and accuracy.
